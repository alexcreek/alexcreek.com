      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s finally time to update this space and consolidate my life. All the old stuff that was here is either in Evernote or if I thought it was slightly useful for anyone else, it&amp;rsquo;s in my gists.
When I was freelancing, this started as a place to put useful stuff that I used more than once. That was quite some time ago, and I&amp;rsquo;ve since learned the difference between doing write ups and having a personal wiki that may or may not be correct AND will eventually suffer from bit rot and be a bad source of reference for others.</description>
