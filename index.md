There used to be a blog here. It got old, I stopped updating it and now it's gone. 

This started on Blogger, moved to Pelican, had a cousin on Medium, failed to launch with Hugo then got put out to pasture.

I used to think you needed a blog to show off your l33t hax0r skillz and get a sick job. Eventually, I realized how it all works:
1. Make something
1. Put it on github
1. Write a blog post about it 
1. Plug it on HN
1. Prepare for the upvotes

Maybe I'll put something here again one day. But chances are, I'll probably just go fishing instead.
